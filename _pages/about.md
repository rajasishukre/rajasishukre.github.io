I am a PhD candidate at Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University. I am working with Dr. Jeremy Marston on Needle-free jet injections.

My thesis work is based on understanding the hydrodynamics of needle-free jet injections. Our aim is to optimize the jet injector device to enhance the delivery efficiency, ease of use, and pain associated with the delivery. This work is currently sponsored by NSF Career Grant and was partly funded by Inovio Pharmaceuticals in the past.

My research interests lies at the interface of transport phenomenon and drug delivery. I am also interested in organismal physics. For published work, see my publications or visit my google scholar profile.
