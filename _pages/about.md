I am a fifth year PhD Candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering at **Texas Tech University** (TTU). I have a bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT), India, and I was a former Process Engineer in the New Delhi office of **Fluor Corporation** for two years before joining Graduate School in the United States. **I am actively seeking opportunities for work in the fields of molecular modeling and simulations, process modeling and optimization, and process intensification.** 


I am passionate about developing sustainable solutions to engineering challenges in the energy sector, particularly related to process intensification. My diverse portfolio of research and process engineering experience is as follows:

1. **Thermodynamic modeling** of fluid phase and adsorption equilibria (gas-solid and liquid-solid)

2. **Molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC)** simulations of gas adsorption

3. **Continuous flow synthesis** of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)

4. Thermophysical property modeling of feedstock, intermediates, and products of biomass pyrolysis – **Model implemented in the _software toolbox of the RAPID Institute_**

5. Process Flow Diagrams (**PFDs**), Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (**PIDs**), Equipment and control valve design, pressure relief valve contingency analysis and HAZOP study

For a detailed description of my projects, please see the Projects Tab.
