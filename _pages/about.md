I am a PhD candidate at Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas Tech University. My thesis work is based on the hydrodynamics of needle-free jet injections. My research work lies at the interface of transport phenomenon and drug delivery. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

    the bad part of this is that it will appear in
    any document you generate from this markdown, such as if
    you convert this markdown to HTML with MacDown or Pandoc.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
